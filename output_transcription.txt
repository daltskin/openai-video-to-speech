So I'm here acting as Alice, one of our system engineers, and we're going to try and access the C portal. You can see I am online because the Bing website is showing. However, if we try to access the C portal, we're forbidden. The reason for this is that we need to be on the VPN to be able to access the C portal. I'm going to open up the Azure VPN client, and connect to our VPN which is on the BAE Specto Azure tenant. We have to log in with our enter ID account. Now we can refresh the page, and we're now prompted to log in to the site. That is great; now you can see we're logged into our C portal as Alice via the secure VPN.
