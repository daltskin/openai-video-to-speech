You can access the internet, as you can see from Bing, but you can't access the C portal. So I'm here acting as Alice, one of our system engineers, and we're going to try and access the C portal. You can see I can access the internet because the Bing image is showing, but if we go and try and access the C portal, we're forbidden. And the reason for this is that we need to be on the VPN to be able to access that portal. So I'm going to open up the Azure VPN client, and I'm going to connect to our VPN. We have to log in with our enter ID account. And then from that point, we can refresh the page, and we're now prompted to log in to the site. There we go. So now you can see we're logged into our C portal as Alice.
